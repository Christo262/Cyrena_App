# Cyréna

Cyréna is an experimental **offline-first engineering assistant** that runs *alongside your IDE*, not inside it.

It operates as a structured agent inside real projects and helps with:

- building features
- repairing compile errors
- enforcing architecture
- maintaining technical documentation
- preserving long-term project knowledge

This project started as a personal experiment to build the assistant I wanted for my own workflow.

It is evolving into something larger.

⚠️ **Please read this README in full before using Cyréna.**  
It contains important safety notes.

## 🎬 Demo

Here is Cyréna running a real prompt → build → repair loop:

This is not code generation —  
this is an engineering agent working inside a project.

## ✨ What Cyréna Is

Cyréna is not a chatbot.

It is a constrained engineering agent that:

- reads a project plan
- inspects real files
- makes minimal edits
- runs iterative repair loops
- persists structured knowledge
- behaves like a disciplined developer

The goal is predictable AI behavior inside real codebases.

---

## 🌍 Multi-Domain Support

Cyréna is designed as a **platform**, not a single-language tool.

Currently supported:

- 🧩 Blazor apps
- 📦 .NET class libraries
- 🔌 Arduino IDE firmware projects

Each domain has its own constraints and prompts, but shares the same core architecture.

This proves the system is extensible.

---

## 🧠 Project Specifications

Project Specifications are structured technical documents generated by the AI and stored with the project.

They describe:

- APIs
- architecture rules
- contracts
- module behavior
- integration patterns

They act as persistent technical memory for the agent.

> The AI reasons from real documentation grounded in real code.

This allows Cyréna to scale beyond context window limits.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Safety

Cyréna enforces strict project structure rules.

The agent cannot invent random folder layouts or escape the project boundary.

This prevents entropy and keeps generated code maintainable.

For Arduino projects, the flat sketch model is enforced.  
For .NET projects, structured folders are enforced.

Different domains, same discipline.

---

## 🔁 Iterative Engineering Workflow

Every action runs through a controlled loop:

1. Read project plan
2. Search specifications
3. Review project notes
4. Inspect relevant files
5. Implement minimal change
6. Build / validate
7. Repair if needed
8. Summarize
9. Persist knowledge

Chat memory resets each iteration.  
Structured knowledge survives.

This avoids long-session drift.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- .NET 10
- Windows / Linux / macOS
- Ollama **or** OpenAI
- Recommended: ≥16k context models

Hardware requirements scale with model size.

---

## Getting Started

Documentation is evolving — thank you for your patience.

### Setup Ollama

1. Run Cyréna
2. Open settings (gear icon)
3. Add an Ollama connection
4. Set model + tokens + context
5. (Optional) Add Tavily API key

### Setup OpenAI

1. Open settings
2. Enter API key + model ID
3. Save

### Create a Project

1. Return to main screen
2. Click **+**
3. Select project type
4. Fill in details
5. Submit

## Hardware Notes

Baseline dev system:

- RTX 3060 (12GB)
- 48GB RAM
- Ryzen 7 8700F

Test model:

- `gpt-oss:20b`
- 8k tokens
- 16k context

Bigger models need more VRAM + RAM.

# ⚠️ Experimental Status

Cyréna is under active development.

It is an autonomous agent capable of modifying real files.

Use version control.  
Use backups.  
Review all changes.

This is not production-hardened software yet.

---

## Known Risks

- Incorrect overwrites
- Imperfect repair loops
- No full rollback yet
- Intent may drift

Always review AI edits.

---

## Safety Systems In Progress

- [ ] Diff keeper
- [ ] Revert mechanism
- [ ] Safe execution guardrails
- [ ] Hard command sandbox

Until complete:

👉 Treat Cyréna as experimental  
👉 Expect mistakes  
👉 Verify output  

---

## Philosophy

Cyréna is being built toward:

- disciplined AI behavior
- reversible changes
- predictable edits
- engineering safety
- long-term project memory

You are seeing the system mid-evolution.

## Disclaimer

Cyréna is experimental software.

It may introduce errors or data loss.

You are responsible for backups and review.
