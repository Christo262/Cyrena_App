# Cyréna

Cyréna is an experimental application designed to run alongside your IDE — not inside it — and assist with real coding tasks.

AI can make software development faster, easier, and more secure. But most tools are subscription-driven, expensive over time, and often don’t quite do what I personally need.

This project started as an attempt to build an assistant for myself.

It may remain an experiment.  
It may grow into something more.  
Right now, it’s a working exploration.

⚠️ **Please read this README in full before using Cyréna. It contains important notes and safety warnings.**

## 🎬 Demo

Here is Cyréna running a full prompt → build → repair loop:

This demonstrates the core engineering workflow in action.

**The system is still experimental and requires manual setup.**

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Project Specifications (persistent AI-readable technical docs)
- 📂 Strict project architecture enforcement
- 🔧 Automated build + repair loop
- 📄 AI-generated specs grounded in real source code
- 📝 Persistent project notes & conventions
- 🔁 Iterative engineering workflow
- 🧩 Blazor Server project support
- 📦 .NET class library support
- 🔍 Tool-driven file inspection
- 🧠 Long-term project knowledge system

Cyréna is built around the idea that AI should behave like a disciplined engineer inside a real codebase.

## 🧠 Project Specifications

Project Specifications are structured technical documents generated by the AI and stored with the project.

They describe:

- APIs
- service contracts
- architecture rules
- integration patterns
- usage examples
- system behavior

Specifications are grounded in actual source code and act as authoritative documentation for future AI reasoning.

Think of them as:

> persistent technical memory for the project

This allows Cyréna to scale beyond raw context window limits.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Safety

Cyréna enforces strict folder and architecture rules so the AI cannot drift or invent random structures.

Example layout:
-	Components/
-	Components/Pages/
-	Components/Layout/
-	Components/Shared/
-	Contracts/
-	Services/
-	Models/
-	Extensions/
-	wwwroot/

The agent is constrained to operate inside this structure.

This prevents entropy and keeps generated projects maintainable.

---

## 🔁 Iterative Workflow

Cyréna runs in controlled iterations:

1. Read project plan
2. Search project specifications
3. Review project notes
4. Inspect relevant files
5. Implement change
6. Build project
7. Fix errors
8. Summarize results
9. Persist new knowledge

Chat history resets after each iteration.  
Only structured knowledge survives.

This avoids context rot and long-session instability.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- .NET 10
- Windows / Linux / macOS
- Ollama
- Recommended: model with ≥16k context

Hardware requirements depend on model size.

---

## Getting Started

Documentation is still evolving — thank you for your patience.
Detailed development documentation will also be provided as soon as possible.

### Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK (Visual Studio or CLI setup as usual)
- Ollama installed and running locally  
  ⚠️ A reasonably powerful machine is recommended (see hardware notes below)

### Setup Ollama Locally

1. Run Cyréna
2. Click the gear icon (bottom right)
3. Add an Ollama connection:
   - Enter endpoint
   - Enter model ID
   - Increase **Tokens** if your system allows
   - Increase **Context** as much as your model supports
   - If your model supports the `think` parameter, you may enable it
4. (Optional) Add a Tavily API key to enable web search

### Setup OpenAI

1. Run Cyréna
2. Click the gear icon (bottom right)
3. Enter API Key & Model Id
	- Tested with ``gpt-5``
4. Save

### Creating a Project

1. Return to the main screen (top left back button)
2. Click the green **+** under Blazor app or Class Library
3. Fill in project details:
   - Name
   - Description
   - Root directory → select your `.csproj`
   - Root namespace
   - Target framework
	- Connection: Select your newly created Ollama or OpenAI connection
4. Click **Submit**

Your project will appear in the Projects window.

Click the blue arrow icon to begin.

### Hardware Notes

Cyréna is currently developed and tested on the following baseline system:

- GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM)
- RAM: 48GB
- CPU: Ryzen 7 8700F

Test model configuration:

- Model: `gpt-oss:20b`
- Tokens: 8k
- Context: 16k

This setup is sufficient for mid-sized local models. Larger models will benefit from additional VRAM and RAM.

Hardware requirements scale directly with model size.

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Experimental Status & Safety Notes

Cyréna is **under active development**.

It is an autonomous engineering agent capable of modifying real project files.  
While safeguards exist, the system is not yet hardened.

**Use with caution.**

Do not run Cyréna on critical production code without backups and version control.

---

## Current Known Risks

- The agent can overwrite files incorrectly
- Automated repair loops may introduce unintended changes
- Build fixes are not guaranteed to preserve intent
- There is no full rollback safety yet

Always use Cyréna inside a version-controlled project.

---

## 🚨 Urgent Safety TODO

These safety systems are actively being built:

- [ ] Diff keeper to track all agent file changes
- [ ] Automatic revert mechanism
- [ ] Safe-guarded .NET action execution
- [ ] Hard block on unsafe commands (#warning tagged areas)

Until these are complete:

👉 Treat Cyréna as an experimental engineering assistant  
👉 Expect mistakes  
👉 Review all generated changes  

---

## Philosophy

Cyréna is being built to become a disciplined engineering agent.

Safety, reversibility, and predictability are core goals —  
but they are not finished yet.

You are seeing the system in motion.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Cyréna is experimental software.

It can modify real project files and may introduce errors, data loss, or unintended changes.

You are responsible for reviewing all generated code and maintaining backups and version control.

The software is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind. Use at your own risk.
